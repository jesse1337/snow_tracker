Project Description (5 Sentences):
Snowboarding and skiing is a hobby shared by many people throughout the Bay Area. However, snow conditions are not always ideal. Some find it difficult to set aside vacation days for their next snow day, so our project will attempt to gather snow level data from previous years in Tahoe, and put together a collective average snow level for that day. Using this data, we will be able to determine what the snow level will be for that day using the average of previous years.
